# globalwishlist

Still in development. First Version will be available in the near future.

A global Wishlist, that pulls Data from Amazon and
- is available offline
- can be sorted

You can add items by ISBN or ASIN from any Amazon Site (.com .co.jp ...) to create a global wishlist.

Developed with
- Javascript - hold and display data
- PHP - fetch data, store list to hd (everything that javascript is not able to do)

Adding items to a list and saving a list needs a php server (the php build-in server is sufficient and super easy to use).
Displaying a list is done in javascript, no php required for this purpose.
